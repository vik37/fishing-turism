                <p>Lake Ohrid is one of the oldest in the world, and the deepest in the Balkans, 
                    with a maximum depth of 288 m (940 ft) and a mean depth of 155 m (508 ft). 
                    It covers an area of 358 km² (138 sq mi), containing an estimated 55.4 km³ of water. 
                    It is 30.4 km long by 14.8 km wide at its maximum extent with a shoreline length of 87.53 km, 
                    shared between Macedonia (56.02 km) and Albania (31.51 km).
                     Of the total surface area, 248 square kilometres (96 sq mi) belongs to Macedonia and 110 km2 
                     belongs to Albania.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Kozjak is an artificial lake in Western Macedonia. It is the largest artificial lake in Macedonia, 
                    located between the mountain Suva Gora in the west and the Jasen reserve in the east. 
                    Towards the lake there are two ways: the southern approach to the lake leads from Makedonski Brod 
                    and stretches along the river Treska. The other approach is from Skopje, 
                    where the road extends along the southern slopes of Vodno. Kozjak is a 32 km long lake, 
                    at some points even 130 meters deep, and the maximum distance from one to the other coast is 400 meters.

                <p>The Vardar is the longest river in Macedonia and the second longest river in Greece, 
                    in which it reaches the Aegean Sea at Solun. It is 388 km (241 mi) long, 
                    out of which 76 km are in Greece, and drains an area of around 25,000 km2 (9,653 sq mi).
                    The maximum depth of the river is 4 m (13 ft).
                    The river rises at Vrutok, a few kilometers southwest of Gostivar in Macedonia. It passes through Gostivar, 
                    Skopje and into Veles, crosses the Greek border near Gevgelija, Polykastro and Axioupoli ("town on the Axiós"), 
                    before emptying into the Aegean Sea in Central Macedonia, west of Thessaloniki in northern Greece.

                    Barbels are group of small carp-like freshwater fish, almost all of the genus Barbus. 
                    They are usually found in gravel and rocky-bottomed slow-flowing waters with high dissolved oxygen content. 
                    A typical adult barbel will range from 25 to 100 cm in length and weigh anywhere between 200 g and 10 kg, 
                    although weights of 200 g are more common. 
                    Babies weigh 100–150 g.
                    Barbels are often fished for food; in some locations they are of commercial significance. The roe of barbels is poisonous, however. 
                    The large Barbus barbs are also often eaten in their native range.
